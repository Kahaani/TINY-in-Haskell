TINY-in-Haskell
===============

TINY Compiler in Haskell.

TINY is a small language described in book [Compiler Construction](http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~louden/cmptext/).
An simple implementation in C was provided by the author.
Now I try to rewrite it in Haskell by hand, before learning Combinator Parsing, without using tools like [Parsec](http://legacy.cs.uu.nl/daan/parsec.html) or [Alex](http://www.haskell.org/alex/)&[Happy](http://www.haskell.org/happy/).
It's quite stupid, but suitable to be my first Haskell project.
