TINY_in_Haskell
===============

TINY Compiler in Haskell.

TINY is a small language described in book [Compiler Construction](http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~louden/cmptext/).
An implementation in C was provided by the author.
Now I try to implement it in Haskell, before learning [Parsec](http://legacy.cs.uu.nl/daan/parsec.html) and [Alex](http://www.haskell.org/alex/)&[Happy](http://www.haskell.org/happy/).
It's suitable to be my first project in Haskell and using Github.
