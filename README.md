#TINY-in-Haskell

TINY Compiler in Haskell.

TINY is a small language described in book [Compiler Construction](http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~louden/cmptext/).
An simple implementation in C was provided by the author.

#Version 1: recursive-descent

It's quite stupid, C style.
I will rewrite it after learning Combinator Parsing, or some tools like [Parsec](http://legacy.cs.uu.nl/daan/parsec.html) or [Alex](http://www.haskell.org/alex/)&[Happy](http://www.haskell.org/happy/).
