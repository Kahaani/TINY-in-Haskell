TINY-in-Haskell
===============

TINY is a simple language described in book [Compiler Construction](http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~louden/cmptext/).
An simple implementation in C was provided by the author.

### Version 1:

Recursive-descent parser, in C style.

It's quite stupid. I will rewrite it after learning Combinator Parsing, or some tools like [Parsec](http://legacy.cs.uu.nl/daan/parsec.html) or [Alex](http://www.haskell.org/alex/)&[Happy](http://www.haskell.org/happy/).

### Version 2:

Recursive-descent parser, with State Monad.

### Version 3:

tbd...
